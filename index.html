          <h2>Majors</h2>
          <br />
          When we announced the Rio Major, we were excited to bring a CS:GO
          Major to one of Counter-Strike’s most passionate fan bases. At the
          time, we couldn’t have imagined the global challenges that have
          limited live events throughout 2020.
          <br />
          <br />
          We’re not going to ask players and fans to risk their health in order
          to attend a Major while the pandemic still poses a threat to
          travelers. Therefore, we have made the painful decision to cancel the
          November Major.
          <br />
          <br />
          So, what’s the plan? First, we’re going to hold off on scheduling
          Majors until, at a minimum, Regional Major Ranking (RMR) LAN events
          are safe to hold around the world. Until then, we expect to continue
          to hold online RMR events to keep track of the best teams in each
          region.
          <br />
          <br />
          <h2>Coaching</h2>
          <br />
          Recently we’ve been made aware that several coaches of professional
          CS:GO teams exploited a bug in the game in order to gain an advantage
          over their opponents. It is unfortunate and frustrating that we did
          not respond to this bug sooner. But bugs are the reality of
          software—and until they are resolved, we need to be able to trust
          players and coaches.
          <br />
          <br />
          We won’t spend much time here reiterating our stance on the importance
          of integrity in CS:GO matches. At a minimum, we expect that players
          and coaches will play by the rules, and immediately pause the match
          and alert tournament admins if they know of an issue that may give
          them (or an opponent) an unfair advantage.
          <br />
          <br />
          Any teams that were disqualified for exploiting this bug during an RMR
          event will have their RMR points reset.
          <br />
          <br />
          As for taking action against individual coaches, we’re going to wait
          until we get a complete picture of the extent of the bug abuse and the
          punishments handed down by third parties. Regardless of those
          penalties, mid-match coaching will always be a tempting opportunity
          for some teams to violate the integrity of the match. So we may also
          consider limitations to coaching.
          <br />
          <br />
          We’re looking forward to getting LAN events started again, and hope
          that we can all find a safe way to do it soon.
